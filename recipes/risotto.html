    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Risotto is one of the tastiest and easiest to make foods, mainly containing medium grain rice, onions and fats.<br>
        For the milanese version, saffron is used to color the rice in a yellowish shade. Beef bone marrow<br>
        and some butter are used to sweat the onions.<br>At the end, some more butter and Parmesan are mixed into
        the hot dish.<br>Debates are going on using wine for Risotto alla milanese. If done so, it is poured onto
        the dish<br>before the bone marrow is added. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g rice (Carnaroli), superfino</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> liter beef broth, no instant</li>
        <li>90 g butter</li>
        <li>100 ml white wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. saffron threads</li>
        <li>75 g Parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>                     
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep the broth hot in a pot without it boiling.</li>
        <li>Soffriggere. In another pot, the shalott is softly sweated in 45g of butter for 5 min, without it turning brown.</li>
        <li>Tostare. Now the rice is being added and stirred until every grain is covered with butter.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat a little and add wine to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Once the wine is steamed, add all the saffron.</li>
        <li>Cuocere. Trowel by trowel add the hot broth to the rice the next 18 minutes or so. The broth has to just start<br>
            boiling, before the next one can be added.<br>Don't forget to constantly stir to prevent grains of rice from sticking
            to the bottom and sides of the pod.</li>
        <li>After about 14 minutes, start reducing the amount of broth to prevent the rice from being liquid in the end.</li>
        <li>Mantecatura. Mix the remaining butter and Parmesan with the rice und add some salt and pepper, as much as you like.</li>
        <li>The perfect consistency, also called "Risotto all' onda", is reached. Now it's time to serve the dish, and don't waste<br>
            time eating it, since it's going to lose it's consistency quickly! Enjoy your meal!</li>
