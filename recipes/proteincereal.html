    <ul style="list-style: none;">You...
        <li>...hit the gym daily?</li>
        <li>...want to save time making food?</li>
        <li>...can't be bothered to have a meal every 1.5 hours?</li>
        <li>...want to eat healthy AND hit all your macros?</li>
        <li>...like to eat fresh and tasty food?</li>
    </ul>
        <p>An oatmeal with many proteins and fibers could be the perfect solution. Combined with some fruit and nuts of your<br>
        choice, this meal really has it all. Easy to make, tasty, healthy, time efficient, rich of proteins and fibers and keeps you<br>saturated.<br>
        Bare in mind, that many fibers might work your stomach, so don't eat it before working out.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>~150 g of Oats</li>

        <li>(optional) more fruit (apple, kiwi, pineapple, pear, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have mixer, use it. This recipe written for the use of a mixer.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your frozen fruit, put it under lukewarm water for rougly 30 seconds. Put your fruit into the mixer.</li>
        <li>Put the bananas inside aswell.</li>
        <li>Same goes for you protein powder.</li>
        <li>Now it's time for the little extras. Put in the nuts you like, and if you feel like it, you might aswell add honey.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk (/water) into the mixer.</li>
        <li>Since there are no limits, if you are creative, add something more if you like.</li>
        <li>Mixing time! Mix for 30 secs on the highest speed.</li>
        <li>Now its time to break some rules. But it's not that crazy. Pour your creation into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour your oats on top, just like on this photo.</li>
        <li>Normally it would now be time to say: Enjoy your meal! BUT...</li>
        <li>...it is important that you DON'T stir your creation. For the best sensation, eat the meal like it is.<br>
        On every spoon from bottom to top, there should first be the juicy, fresh mix, and on top the oats. Try it out!</li>
    </ol>
