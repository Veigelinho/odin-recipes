    <p>Everybody needs water. The human body is made of at least <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of water. Most peoole underestimate that.<br>
    Everyday, try to carry water to wherever you are, and try make it a habit to drink water frequently. Water flows.<br>
    Like a river. It is no coincidence that the biggest cities in the world build themselves around water. Because where<br>
    water flows, life thrives. Does water flow through your body? Or do you dry your body out? Many people feel tired<br>
    after a little effort, and can't seem to figure out why. Drinking too little water is one of the most underestimated reasons.<br>
    <strong>Drink more water and see your energy & life change!</strong></p>
